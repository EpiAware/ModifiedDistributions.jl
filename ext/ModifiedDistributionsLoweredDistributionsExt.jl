# ModifiedDistributions × LoweredDistributions
#
# The source-owned bridge (CensoredDistributions#846): each package that owns a
# distribution type owns its `lower` methods, carried as a weak-dependency
# extension on LoweredDistributions. `lower(dist)::AbstractLowering` maps a
# distribution onto a backend-agnostic dynamical-systems representation (a
# `CTMC` or an `AbstractChainTrick` phase-type). This extension defines `lower`
# for ModifiedDistributions' modifier leaves.
#
# The bridge is PARTIAL by mathematical necessity: a modifier bears either
# *dynamics* (it lowers) or *observation* (it must be refused, never silently
# approximated). The contract mirrors LoweredDistributions' own throw-on-
# non-integer-Erlang pattern: an explicit `ArgumentError` rather than a wrong
# lowering.
#
#   ✅ Lowers
#     - `Affine` with `shift = 0`: a phase-type is closed under positive
#       rescaling, so `Y = scale · X` divides every transition rate by `scale`.
#     - (`Modified` on an Exponential leaf, below — a constant hazard stays
#       constant under a hazard modification, so the modified leaf is again an
#       Exponential and lowers exactly.)
#
#   ❌ Refused (explicit throw)
#     - `Affine` with `shift ≠ 0`: a deterministic added delay is not
#       phase-type (no finite Markov chain has a deterministic holding time).
#     - `Weighted`: a likelihood weight is pure observation, zero dynamics.
#     - `Transformed` (`thin`/`cumulative`/`series_transform`): a forward series
#       op. `thin` *would* lower as a competing-risk split, but that needs a
#       NoEvent absorbing sink LoweredDistributions' wave-1 API does not expose
#       (see the `thin` branch). `cumulative` and a general series map have no
#       rate-structure image at all.
#     - `Modified` on a non-Exponential leaf: proportional/additive hazards are
#       exact rate-scaling only when the base hazard is constant; on an Erlang
#       (or any non-Exponential) the modified object is not phase-type.
#     - `Modified` under a non-analytic link (logit): discrete-time / needs
#       numeric integration, no CTMC image.
#
# Function owner: LoweredDistributions (`lower`). Type owner:
# ModifiedDistributions (`Affine` / `Weighted` / `Transformed` / `Modified`).
# The extension depends on both, so there is no type piracy.

# lowered representation exactly: a phase-type is closed under time-scaling, so
# multiplying the holding times by `scale` divides every transition rate by
# `scale`. A non-zero `shift` adds a deterministic delay, which no finite
# Markov chain reproduces, so it is refused rather than mis-lowered.

#     all mass on event-reaching phases (`sum(α) = 1`), so it cannot carry the
#     `1 - p` mass that never events. So `thin` is refused until that sink

# --- Modified: exact only on a constant-hazard Exponential leaf --------------

# A hazard modification `h*(t) = g⁻¹(g(h(t)) + effect)` is exact rate-scaling
# only when the base hazard `h` is constant, i.e. the leaf is an Exponential.
# There the modified leaf is again an Exponential and lowers exactly:
#
#   - log link (proportional hazards): `h* = exp(effect) · λ`, so the modified
#     leaf is `Exponential(θ · exp(-effect))`;
#   - identity link (additive hazards): `h* = λ + effect` (the constructor
#     forces `effect ≥ 0`, so `h* > 0`), the modified leaf is
#     `Exponential(1 / (λ + effect))`.
#
# On any non-Exponential leaf the base hazard varies with time, so the modified
# object is not phase-type (it would need time-varying rates); that is refused.
# A logit (or any non-log/identity) link is discrete-time / needs numeric
# integration and has no CTMC image.
