A distribution whose hazard is modified through a link.

`Modified` carries a base distribution `dist`, a hazard `effect`, a
[`HazardLink`](@ref) `link` and a quadrature `method`, and lazily instantiates
the modified hazard

```math
h^{*}(t) = g^{-1}\\!\\big(g(h(t)) + \\text{effect}\\big)
```

in `logpdf`/`cdf`/`ccdf`/`rand`, where `g` is the link and
`h(t) = f(t)/S(t)` the base hazard. The modification is never materialised
eagerly, so a `Modified` composes with everything that consumes a
`UnivariateDistribution`.

The instantiation path is chosen by dispatch on the base and the link:

- continuous base, [`LogLink`](@ref): analytic proportional hazards,
  ``S^{*} = S^{e^{\\beta}}``;
- continuous base, [`IdentityLink`](@ref) with a non-negative effect and a
  finite lower support bound `m`: analytic additive hazards,
  ``S^{*}(t) = S(t)\\,e^{-\\beta (t - m)}``;
- continuous base, any other link (or a negative additive effect, or a callable
  `effect(t)`): numeric, integrating the modified cumulative hazard through the
  `method` quadrature solver. The integrator assumes an eventually-monotone
  hazard, and a negative additive (or general-link) effect clamps the hazard at
  zero — for a base with a non-monotone (peak-then-decay) hazard the clamp can
  make the modified law defective (sub-stochastic, integrating to less than
  one), in which case `quantile`/`rand` above the total mass are undefined;
- discrete base with a per-bin effect vector: exact per-bin PMF reconstruction
  through the discrete-time reporting hazard.

# Fields
- `dist`: the base distribution whose hazard is modified.
- `effect`: the hazard modification (a scalar, a callable `effect(t)`, or a

- `link`: the hazard link `g` and its inverse.

Modify the hazard of a distribution through a link.

`modify(d, effect; link = log)` returns a [`Modified`](@ref) distribution whose
hazard is ``h^{*}(t) = g^{-1}(g(h(t)) + \\text{effect})``, where `g` is the
`link` (`log` for proportional hazards, `identity` for additive hazards,
`:logit` for a discrete-time reporting hazard, or any invertible callable via
[`hazard_link`](@ref)). The modification is instantiated lazily, so the result
composes everywhere a `UnivariateDistribution` does.

For a continuous base the `log` link (and the `identity` link with a
non-negative effect) use closed forms; any other link, a negative additive
effect, or a callable `effect(t)` integrates the modified cumulative hazard
numerically through the `method` solver. For a discrete base, `effect` is a
per-bin vector and the modified PMF is reconstructed exactly through the
discrete-time reporting hazard, for any link including a user callable.

The non-negative `identity` link also requires a base with a finite lower
support bound `m` (the extra hazard accrues from `m`).

The numeric path assumes an eventually-monotone base hazard. A negative
additive (or general-link) effect clamps the modified hazard at zero, so for a
base with a non-monotone (peak-then-decay) hazard the clamped law can be
defective (sub-stochastic, integrating to less than one); its `cdf` stays
monotone, but `quantile`/`rand` above the total mass throw an `ArgumentError`.

Differentiating a modified law through the base parameters uses the base's own
`logccdf`. `LogNormal` and `Weibull` bases differentiate under ForwardDiff on
both the closed-form and numeric paths; a `Gamma` base does not, because
`StatsFuns` has no AD rule for its log-survival — differentiating the `effect`
alone still works, and the AD-safe gamma survival stays upstream in
CensoredDistributions.

# Arguments
- `d`: the base distribution.
- `effect`: the hazard modification. A scalar or a callable `effect(t)` on a
  continuous base; a per-bin vector on a discrete base.

  symbols `:log`/`:identity`/`:logit`, or a [`HazardLink`](@ref) such as

Compute the quantile by monotone bisection of the modified CDF.

The log link keeps its closed form; the additive and numeric paths invert the
monotone cdf by bracketed bisection, so a hazard increase (a tighter law) and a
hazard decrease (a wider law) are both handled.

A negative additive effect (and a general link) can push the modified hazard
below zero, so the model is the clamped hazard `max(h(t) + β, 0)`. Clamping
away early hazard can leave a base with a non-monotone (peak-then-decay) hazard
sub-stochastic: the cumulative distribution converges to a total mass below
one. When the requested `p` exceeds that total mass the quantile is undefined,
so this throws an `ArgumentError` rather than returning a garbage bracket.

# Discrete base: exact per-bin reporting-hazard reconstruction
# ============================================================================
#
# The discrete path lifts the per-bin reporting hazard onto a distribution: the
# base PMF over the integer grid is reshaped per bin through the link, then the
# interval masses come straight from the reconstructed PMF. The `effect` is a
# per-bin vector. Works for any link, including a user callable, since each bin
# is the cheap scalar map g⁻¹(g(h_d) + effect_d).
#
# A per-bin vector effect (not a scalar or callable) selects this path, so the
# discrete and continuous method sets are disjoint by effect type even though a
# discrete base is itself a `UnivariateDistribution`.
#
# Scope note: this covers a plain discrete `UnivariateDistribution` (integer
# grid from its support minimum, unit width). CensoredDistributions' epinowcast
# reference-by-report expected-count MATRIX layer (`reference_report_matrix`)
# and the interval-censoring-specific grid stay upstream, since they need the
# interval-censoring discretisation helpers that live there.
