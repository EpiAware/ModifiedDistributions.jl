@doc "

A distribution wrapper that applies a weight to the log-probability of an
underlying distribution.
This is primarily used where observations have associated counts or weights.

Only the `logpdf` method is affected by the weight - all other methods (pdf,
cdf, sampling, etc.) delegate directly to the underlying distribution.

# Weight Types Supported

The `Weighted` struct supports three different weight scenarios:

1. **Real weights**: Constructor weight is a specific value (e.g., `2.5`)
2. **Missing weights**: Constructor weight is `missing`, allowing weights to be
   provided at observation time via joint observations `(value = x, weight = w)`
3. **Zero weights**: Handled specially to return `-Inf` and avoid NaN from
   `0 * -Inf`

# Examples
```@example
using ModifiedDistributions, Distributions

# Single weighted observation
d = LogNormal(1.5, 0.5)
wd = weight(d, 10.0)  # Observation with weight/count of 10

# Weighted log-probability calculation
observed_value = 2.0
weighted_logpdf = logpdf(wd, observed_value)

# Compare with manual calculation
manual_logpdf = 10.0 * logpdf(d, observed_value)
# weighted_logpdf ≈ manual_logpdf
```

@doc "

Create a weighted distribution where the log-probability is scaled by `w`.

A `Weighted` distribution will contribute `w * logpdf(dist, x)` to the
log-probability when evaluating `logpdf(weighted_dist, x)`.
Unlike an ad hoc `w * logpdf(dist, x)` term in model code, the result is
still a real distribution whose sampling delegates to `dist`, so a
Turing.jl model (or any PPL built on Distributions.jl) that uses it stays a
complete generative model with working prior and posterior-predictive
simulation.

# Examples
```@example
using ModifiedDistributions, Distributions

# For aggregated count data
y_obs = 3.5  # Observed value
n_count = 25  # Number of times this value was observed

d = Normal(2.0, 1.0)
weighted_d = weight(d, n_count)

# Weighted log-probability calculation
weighted_logpdf = logpdf(weighted_d, y_obs)
# equivalent to: n_count * logpdf(d, y_obs)
```
"
function weight(dist::UnivariateDistribution, w::Real)
    return Weighted(dist, w)
end

@doc "

Return the distribution unweighted when the weight is `nothing`.

This lets callers thread an optional weight through `weight(dist, w)` and pass
`nothing` to mean \"no weight\": the distribution is returned unchanged.

# Examples
```@example
using ModifiedDistributions, Distributions

d = Normal(2.0, 1.0)
weight(d, nothing) === d
```
"
function weight(dist::UnivariateDistribution, ::Nothing)
    return dist
end

@doc "

Create a product distribution of weighted distributions, each with a different
weight.

A `Product` distribution of `Weighted` distributions suitable for vectorised
observations.

# Arguments
- `dist`: The univariate distribution to be replicated and weighted for each observation
- `weights`: Vector of weights to apply to each copy of the distribution

# Examples
```@example
using ModifiedDistributions, Distributions

y_obs = [3.5, 4.2, 3.8]  # Observed values
n_counts = [25, 10, 15]  # Counts for each observation

d = Normal(2.0, 1.0)
weighted_dists = weight(d, n_counts)

# Weighted log-probability calculation
weighted_logpdf = logpdf(weighted_dists, y_obs)
# equivalent to: sum(n_counts .* logpdf.(d, y_obs))
```

end

@doc "

Create a product distribution of weighted distributions, where each
distribution has its own weight.

A `Product` distribution of `Weighted` distributions suitable for vectorised
observations with different distributions.

# Examples
```@example
using ModifiedDistributions, Distributions

y_obs = [3.5, 4.2, 3.8]  # Observed values
dists = [Normal(2.0, 0.5), Normal(2.5, 0.8), Normal(1.8, 0.6)]
n_counts = [25, 10, 15]  # Counts for each observation

Create a weighted distribution with missing constructor weight.

Useful for creating distributions where weights will be provided at observation
time. Uses `missing` as constructor weight, enabling observation weight to be
used directly.

weights.
